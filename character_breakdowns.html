Through sixty miles of hell carrying a fifty-pound copper still, she transforms from dutiful daughter to someone who chooses life over legacy. Arc: "The copper is everything" becomes "The copper is nothing. We are everything."</p>

                    <p class="character-text">Physically and emotionally demanding lead. A character who rarely speaks but whose internal journey must be visible in every frame.

                    <p class="character-text">Face like a Baptist preacher, eyes like a hanging judge—until Abel's attack leaves him horrifically scarred with boiling copper. Dark suit, badge, pistol. Visibly deteriorates throughout—infection, fever, limping, dying.</p>

                    <p class="character-text">The antagonist who believes he's the hero. His wife died in childbirth in these mountains. Haunted by memories of watching people die from government-poisoned alcohol, yet continues enforcing the policy. Righteous enforcer whose certainty crumbles as he hunts Birdie. Final words: "Tell them we killed them. Not the bootleggers. Us."</p>

                    <p class="character-text">Complex antagonist doing terrible things while believing he's righteous. Requires an actor who can be both threatening and tragic. Physical deterioration must be visible and visceral. Not a villain—a cautionary tale about principle becoming tyranny.</p>

                <div class="character-section">
                    <p class="character-text">Represents the old way—pride, principle, tradition. Master craftsman who sees moonshining as art, survival, and resistance. Loves his daughter fiercely but burdens her with his war. Dies in opening raid attacking Beck. Haunts Birdie's journey through exhaustion-induced hallucinations. Final message: "I'm helping you survive long enough to let it go."</p>

                    <p class="character-text">Though he dies early, his presence shapes the entire film. Requires an actor who can convey deep paternal love and dangerous pride. Must be both inspirational and cautionary—a man who died for principle, whose daughter must choose differently.</p>

                <div class="character-section">
                    <p class="character-text">Birdie's mother. Dying of tuberculosis. Weathered, coughing blood, sharp-minded. Tells Birdie where the copper is hidden. Dies quietly in opening act. Ashes scattered in epilogue thirty years later. Small but crucial role—requires conveying a lifetime of hardship and quiet strength in limited screen time.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="character-card">

                <div class="character-section">
                    <p class="character-text">Memphis bootlegger. Suit, cigars, careful formality. Buyer for the copper still—$200 if delivered within 48 hours. Not cruel, just businesslike. Pays Birdie and asks no questions about the blood. Urban sophistication contrasting with mountain culture.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="character-section">
                    <p class="character-text">Rival moonshiner. Massive, scarred, voice like grinding stone. Wants the copper. Ambushes Birdie on Knoxville outskirts. "Surrender the copper and live, or fight and die." She runs. Represents bootlegging brutality—no honor, only violence and profit. Requires physical presence and menace without theatricality.</p>

                    <p class="character-text">Virgil's youngest son. Sent to track Birdie but warns her instead. Young, conflicted, escaping his father's shadow. "Because I got sisters." Brief but memorable—unexpected humanity in a brutal world. Small role with significant emotional impact.</p>

                    <p class="character-text">Beck's team. Participate in opening raid, pursue Birdie, witness Beck's deterioration and death.

Ensemble of 3-5 actors shifting from righteous enforcers to men questioning orders.</p>

                    <p class="character-text">Birdie thirty years later, scattering Ruth's ashes with her grown daughter. Survived, built new life, broken the cycle.
