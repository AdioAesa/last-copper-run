                <p><strong>THE LAST COPPER RUN</strong> opens in the predawn darkness of November 1928, where moonshine drips from copper coils like a heartbeat—clear as mountain water, deadly as sin. This is the world of the McCallisters, fourth-generation moonshiners whose copper stills produce the only safe liquor left in Appalachia.</p>

                <p>When federal prohibition agents raid their still house, <strong>Abel McCallister</strong> makes a choice that will echo through the mountains: he throws his daughter a leather pouch containing forty-three dollars and commands her to run. Moments later, he attacks Agent Harlan Beck with boiling moonshine and copper, scarring the lawman's face before dying in a hail of gunfire.</p>

                <p><strong>Birdie McCallister</strong>, twenty-six and secretly pregnant with her dead lover's child, returns to find her father's charred remains and her mother Ruth dying of consumption. Ruth reveals that the family's masterwork—a fifty-pound copper still worth two hundred dollars—is hidden in a cave. Birdie has forty-eight hours to deliver it to Jack Price in Knoxville before he leaves for Memphis. That money represents medicine, train fare west, and escape from the cycle of violence that killed both her father and her lover Tommy.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>THE LAST COPPER RUN is grounded in one of America's darkest chapters: between 1920 and 1933, the U.S. government deliberately poisoned industrial alcohol to deter bootlegging. The policy killed over 10,000 Americans and blinded thousands more.</p>

                <p>The government added methanol, formaldehyde, and other deadly chemicals to industrial alcohol, knowing bootleggers would redistill it for consumption. When people drank it, they went blind, then suffered organ failure over days of agonizing screaming. The victims were predominantly poor, working-class Americans in Appalachia and urban areas.</p>

                <p>This film tells their story through Birdie's journey. Her lover Tommy died from poisoned whiskey—three days of going blind, organs burning, body seizing. Her father's pure copper stills represented salvation: properly made moonshine was the only safe alcohol left. This wasn't just about breaking the law; it was about survival in the face of government-sanctioned murder.</p>

                    <p class="section-content">Opening with the hypnotic drip of moonshine, we watch Abel test his work—blue flame, perfect. When federal agents surround the still house, Abel throws Birdie a pouch and commands her to run. He then attacks Beck with boiling copper and moonshine, scarring the agent's face before dying in a storm of gunfire. Birdie counts each shot from the forest. Six bullets. Her father is gone.</p>

                    <p class="section-content">The Nolichucky River runs fast and cold. Birdie strips to underclothes, wraps the copper in her coat, and wades in. The current tears at her. The copper pulls her under. She must choose: the copper or her life. She releases it, swims for the surface, gasping—only to find it caught on a branch in shallow water. Her father's ghost whispers: "Two feet to your left."</p>

His son Wyatt warned her this was coming—Beck herded her right into Shaw's trap. She refuses. Runs. Bullets chase her into the river. She escapes, but barely.</p>

Beck's crusade collapses as he realizes he enforced policies that killed innocents. His final words to his men: "Tell them we killed them. Not the bootleggers. Us." He dies remembering their names.</p>

                <p><strong>THE LAST COPPER RUN</strong> demands visceral, grounded cinematography that puts the audience directly into Birdie's ordeal:</p>

                <p><strong>Fog and darkness:</strong> The film lives in the gray zones—predawn mist, twilight forests, lamplight in still houses. Color palette: cold blues, copper oranges, charcoal blacks.</p>

                <p><strong>Close physical detail:</strong> We see copper stains on hands, blood seeping through shirts, breath misting in cold air, the shine of moonshine catching lamplight. The camera stays intimate, making us feel every mile.</p>

                <p><strong>Natural sound design:</strong> The drip of copper, the crunch of boots on frost, the roar of the river, the crack of rifles echoing through hollows. Minimal score, maximizing diegetic mountain sounds.</p>

                <p><strong>Handheld intensity:</strong> During action sequences—the raid, the river crossing, the chase from Shaw's men—the camera becomes Birdie's POV, breathless and immediate.</p>

                <p><strong>The mountains as character:</strong> We establish the Smokies as vast, indifferent, beautiful, and deadly. Ridge after ridge disappearing into fog. The endless weight of distance.</p>

            <p class="subtitle" style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: #d4a574; font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 2rem; text-align: center;">THE LAST COPPER RUN resurrects a forgotten American atrocity.</p>

            <div class="image-banner" style="background-image: url('hospital.png');"></div>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Between 1920 and 1933, the U.S. government poisoned over 10,000 of its own citizens in the name of enforcing Prohibition. Most victims were poor, rural, or working-class. Most of their names are lost to history.</p>

                <p>This film is a memorial. It's also a reckoning with how governments rationalize violence against marginalized communities, how principle becomes tyranny, and how ordinary people resist.</p>

                <p>But beyond the historical importance, this is a survival story about a woman refusing to carry her father's war. It's about breaking generational cycles. It's about choosing life over legacy.</p>

                <p>In an era when we're re-examining government overreach, economic inequality, and who gets to decide which laws are just—THE LAST COPPER RUN feels urgent, necessary, and painfully relevant.</p>
